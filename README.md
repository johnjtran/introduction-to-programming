# Introduction to Programming

This purpose of this course is to get students started on a programming journey using the [clojure](http://clojure.org) programming language.  The primary purpose of this course is to help students learn to program "correctly" and to learn how to solve problems by focusing more on the development of algorithms and less emphasis on data structure.

Throughout the course, we will jump around different websites and youtube videos. While this can be a challenging and distracting, it is important that students read each set of lecture notes or watch each video, in its entirety.  Students should also respond to the discussion questions **and** do the exercises. Finally, each of the lessons is built on the previous one, therefore students should not jump ahead without first completing the preceding lessons.

The course is consisted of XX lessons.  For each lesson, students are expected to spend 20 - 30 minutes on the reading materials (or watching the instructional videos) and 30 - 60 minutes on the programming assignments.

The course instructional materials can be found on the [Wiki](wiki) page.

Good luck!
